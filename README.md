This is my personal project for analyzing the results of the runners of the Rotterdam Marathon.

I have this marathon four times myself and was curious to learn more about the runners, the times and best pacing for personal bests. Further goal was to teach myself data science using different tools and concepts such as python, pandas, tidydata, visualization.


Using mostly Python (and a little bit of R) to scrape the results from uitslagen.nl and sporthyves.com.
